Welcome to the Chemistry section.  

Each section corresponds to a topic taught in the first year Natural Sciences Chemistry. Each course has material, questions and answers. If you spot any errors with the content, questions or answers please do not edit the files directly, just drop us an email at j.weber@sheffield.ac.uk. We are also keen to improve the learning experience so are always happy to have your feedback (please use same email).

We hope you find the material helpful.
