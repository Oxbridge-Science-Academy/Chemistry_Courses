# Orbitals and Wavefunctions

At this stage it is worth pausing and considering what an atomic orbital actually is. To do this we need to consider wavefunctions (typically represented by the symbol <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi ">) 
since atomic orbitals are wavefunctions. 

## Wavefunctions

Wavefunctions are mathematical functions which describe a system, in 1 or more dimensions. They are useful because once their mathematical form is known, we can derive information about a system by performing certain operations on them. For example, we cannot say precisely where an electron is in an orbital but, by multiplying the relevant orbital's wavefunction by its complex conjugate (wavefunctions are often, although not always, complex expressions) to give <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\psi|^2">, we gain information about the probability of finding an electron at a particular coordinate.

Orbitals are one-electron 3-dimensional wavefunctions and each one has a unique set of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">, ll and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l"> values. This makes sense as it was mentioned in Section 1 that the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l"> values define a particular orbital. 

However, there are an infinite number of possible functions – just consider all the different possible combinations of polynomial, logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric functions possible. How do we know which functions describe the atom?
 
It turns out that the correct functions are those which are solutions to the Schrödinger equation, a 1-dimensional version of which is shown below. The mathematics is not much beyond high school level - you will recognise the second derivative on the left hand side but the derivation of the Schrödinger equation and the full detail of its use is beyond the scope of this course.

For interest, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi (x)">  is the one dimensional wavefunction, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m"> the mass of an electron, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=V(x)"> a function describing the potential energy and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E"> the energy of the atomic orbital. 


The complete 3-dimensional mathematical form of the wavefunctions describes a 3 dimensional shape which is the atomic orbital. The full equations for these orbitals is beyond the scope of this course but it is important to understand the general shape of the different types of orbitals since this affects how they are able to overlap and form molecular orbital and bonds. 

This course will examine the simplest orbital of each type - the 1s, 2p and 3d – for the Hydrogen atom but the ideas presented here are still valid when dealing with more complex orbitals. 

## Coordinates
We have seen that orbitals are 3 dimensional functions of the cartesian coordinates <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x,y,z"> and each has a unique set of values of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n, l, m_l, m_s">. This can expressed mathematically as: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi_{n,l,m_l,m_s}(x,y,z)">

However, it can be more convenient to use spherical polar coordinates <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r,\theta,\phi"> where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r"> is the radial distance from the origin,  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> is the polar angle (extending "down" from the positive <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> axis) and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi"> is the azimuthal angle (extending anticlockwise from the positive <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> axis) as shown. (Note that other definitions of spherical polar coordinates are used. The one given here is standard for Chemistry and Physics.)  

Thus the wave function can also be expressed as: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi_{n,l,m_l,m_s}(r,θ,ϕ)">

This allows the wavefunction to be split into a radial part, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R">, which depends only on the radial distance for the nucleus, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r">, and an angular part, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y">
, which depends on <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta">
 and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi">
, and largely determines the orbital’s 3 dimensional shape.
