# 1s Orbitals

 The 1s orbital is lowest energy orbital and most tightly bound to the nucleus. The angular part of the s orbital wavefunction (for any value of nn) is a constant (independent of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi(\theta,\phi)">) and so all s orbitals are spherically symmetric. The wavefunction, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi">, is equal at all points on the surface of sphere at a given radial distance from the nucleus. 
 
Since <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\psi(x)|^2"> is proportional to the probability of finding an electron at a particular coordinate (strictly it is a probability density), there is an equal chance of finding the electron anywhere on the spherical surface. This has important consequences when we consider the formation of molecular orbitals during bond formation. Essentially, another orbital can approach an s orbital from any direction to bond to it.

The 1s orbital has no radial or angular nodes; in other words <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi \neq 0"> for all coordinates. s orbitals with higher principal quantum numbers do have radial nodes. 

The isosurface plot of the 1st orbital is shown again below.  


The iso-surface plot shows us the general shape of the wavefunction for an s orbital. As the s orbital is spherically symmetric, the value of the wavefunction will change in the same manner regardless of direction you travel out from the nucleus. The nature of this change is determined by the radial component of the wavefunction:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R(r)\propto e^{-a r}">

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r"> is the radial distance from the nucleus and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\a"> is a constant.

This tell us that the wavefunction decreases going away from the nucleus and this is shown in the contour and "slice" plots below.
 
Furthermore, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\psi|^2">  also decreases rapidly going way from the nucleus. This suggests mostly likely place (coordinate) to find an electron is at the nucleus.



# 2s & 3s Orbitals

Like the 1s, the 2s and 3s orbitals are spherically symmetric with no angular nodes (since l=0l=0). The 2s has one radial node and 3s has 2 radial nodes. However, the 2s and 3s have more complicated radial parts of their wavefunction. 

## 2s orbital

The radial part of the 2s wavefunction is: 

 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_{2s}(r)=(\alpha-r)e^{-2r \beta}"> 
 
Where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha & \beta">  are constants.

The single radial node is found when:

 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_{2s}(r)=0 \Rightarrow r= \alpha"> 

This is shown in the plots below.

This is first instance we have seen of the wavefunction changing sign. For <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0 < r < \alpha">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi > 0"> and when <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r > \alpha"> , <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi < 0"> . This change in sign of the wavefunction is called a **"phase change"** and will be discussed more in the context of the p and d orbitals. 
 
In the contour plot, not the spherical symmetry and the change in wavefunction sign of the contours as the contours change style.


## 3s orbital
The radial part of the 3s wavefunction is a little more complex:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_{3s}(r)="> <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(\gamma - \delta r + "> + <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r^2)e^{-3r\eta}">

Where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma, \delta & \eta ="> are constants. 
From the quadratic term it should be obvious that the 3s has 2 radial nodes and thus 2 phase changes.
