### Q1
*Which type of orbitals are found in the n=4 shell?*

For the n=4, the angular momentum quantum number l can take values 0,1...,n−1⇒l=0,1,2,3.
Therefore s (l=0), p (l=1), d (l=2) and f (l=3) orbitals are found in the n=4 shell. 

### Q2
*How many s orbitals (l=0) and d orbitals (l=2) are there in the n=3 shell?*

s orbitals are always singly degenerate as l=0⇒2l+1=1 so there is 1 s orbital.
d orbitals are always have 5-fold degeneracy as l=2⇒2l+1=5l so there are 5 d orbitals.

### Q3
*How many g orbitals (l=4) would you expect to find in the level with n=5?*

The degeneracy of an orbital is 2l+1. In this case 2l+1=9 so there are 9 degenerate g orbitals. However, you be relieved to hear that these are seldom discussed in chemistry and you are unlikely to encounter them in the first couple years of your undergraduate degree.
