### Q6
*In 1 dimension, the probability of finding an electron in a small length <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=dx"> is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\psi(x)|^2 dx">. Given that the electron must exist somewhere in space, what is the numerical value of the following integral?*

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\infinity}^{\infinity}|\psi(x)|^2 dx">

The total probability of finding the electron is 1. Therefore the integral must be equal to 1.

### Q7
*Starting with the equation: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E_n=-\frac{R_H Z^2}{n^2}"> derive an expression for the energy of a transition, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E_{if}">, which starts at level with principal quantum <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_i">
 and finishes at level <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f"> for the Hydrogen atom in terms of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle R_H">. *
 
 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E_{if}=E_f-E_i=-\frac{R_H}{n_f^2}--\frac{R_H}{n_i^2}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle =\frac{R_H}{n_i^2}-\frac{R_H}{n_f^2}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle =R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_i^2}-\frac{1}{n_f^2} \right) ">



### Q8
* Using your answer to Q7, show that the ratio of the energy of the 2→1 transition is to the energy of the 3→2 transition is 5.4 and the ratio of the energy of the 2→1 transition  to the energy of the 4→3 transition is ~15.4. What does this suggest about the relative energies of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=1">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_3=1"> series in the hydrogen emissions spectrum and their location in the EM spectrum? *

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle 2 \rightarrow 1 \Delta E_{21}=R_HZ \left( \frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{1^2} \right) = -\frac{3}{4} R_H">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle 3 \rightarrow 2 \Delta E_{32}=R_HZ \left( \frac{1}{3^2}-\frac{1}{2^2} \right) = -\frac{5}{36} R_H">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle 4 \rightarrow 3 \Delta E_{43}=R_HZ \left( \frac{1}{4^2}-\frac{1}{3^2} \right) = -\frac{7}{144} R_H">

Taking the ratios

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{\Delta E_{21}}{\Delta E_{32}} =-\frac{3 R_H}{4} \times -\frac{36}{5} = \frac{108}{20} = 5.4 ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{\Delta E_{21}}{\Delta E_{43}} =-\frac{3 R_H}{4} \times -\frac{144}{7} = \frac{432}{28} = 15.4 ">

This suggests that there are large energy differences between the different series in the hydrogen emission spectrum and they are therefore likely to be located in different parts of the EM spectrum. This is indeed the case with the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=1">
 (Lyman) series found in the UV region, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=2">
 (Balmer) series in the visible/UV region and the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=3"> (Paschen) series in the infra-red region. 


### Q9
Calculate the relative energies of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n=1,2,3,4">  shells in Hydrogen and, using the idea of electron transitions, explain quantitatively the atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Delta E_n=-\frac{R_H}{n^2} \Rightarrow E_1=-R_H, E_2=-\frac{R_H}{4}, E_3=-\frac{R_H}{9}, E_4=-\frac{R_H}{16}, E_5=-\frac{R_H}{25}">

We note that the energies tend towards <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Delta E_n=-\frac{R_-R_H"> which is the (negative) ionisation energy. Furthermore, we see that the energies get closer together: difference between ΔE41 and ΔE51is 0.0225RH while the difference between ΔE21 and ΔE31 is 0.139RH, over 6 times larger. This explains why, within a single series, the lines in an emission spectrum get closer together, eventually converging to an energy equal to the ionisation energy.
This convergence is seen below. Note that the wavelength of the emission is shown, rather than the energy. The wavelength  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \lambda">
 is inversely proportional to the energy of a photon E as shown by the equation:
 
 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E=\frac{h \nu}{\lambda} =\frac{hc}{\lambda}">

Where c is the speed of light and h the Planck constant. 

Therefore the lowest energy transition (termed Lyman-αα) has the highest wavelength.
