### Q6
In 1 dimension, the probability of finding an electron in a small length <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=dx"> is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|\psi(x)|^2 dx">. Given that the electron must exist somewhere in space, what is the numerical value of the following integral? 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \int_{-\infinity}^{\infinity}|\psi(x)|^2 dx">

### Q7
Starting with the equation:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E_n=-\frac{R_H Z^2}{n^2}">

derive an expression for the energy of a transition, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E_{if}">, which starts at level with principal quantum <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_i">
 and finishes at level <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f"> for the Hydrogen atom in terms of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle R_H">. 


### Q8
Using your answer to Q7, show that the ratio of the energy of the 2→1 transition is to the energy of the 3→2 transition is 5.4 and the ratio of the energy of the 2→1 transition  to the energy of the 4→3 transition is ~15.4. What does this suggest about the relative energies of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=1">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_f=2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n_3=1"> series in the hydrogen emissions spectrum and their location in the EM spectrum? 


### Q9
Calculate the relative energies of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n=1,2,3,4">  shells in Hydrogen and, using the idea of electron transitions, explain quantitatively the atomic emission spectrum of hydrogen.
