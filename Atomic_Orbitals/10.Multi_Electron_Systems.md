# Multi-Electron Systems

Every atom except Hydrogen has more than one electron. If we consider a particular electron, to calculate its energy (which affects its reactivity), we must consider its interaction with the nucleus (attractive - lowers electron's energy) and the other electrons (repulsive - raises electron's energy). However, this is not straightforward.
 
### Shielding 
This phenomenon, also called "screening" in some literature, involves the other electrons in an atom reducing the attractive interaction between the electron of interest and the nucleus. We see the effects of shielding when looking at the nth ionisation energy (1st,2nd,3rd...) for a particular element. For example, when looking at the ionisation energies of Magnesium, a large jump is observed when we go from removing electrons from the n=3 level to the n=2. This is because the electrons in the n=1 and n=2 levels shield the n=3 electrons effectively, reducing the nuclear charge felt by the n=3 electrons, thus raising their energy (less negative) and making them easier to remove. By contrast, electrons with the same principal quantum number do not shield each other very well so the nuclear charge felt by the electrons in the n=2 level is considerably greater than the n=3n=3 electron and so they have a much greater ionisation energy. 

The effect of shielding is described by the parameter called the effective nuclear charge, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle Z_{eff}">. This is the actual nuclear charge experienced by an electron; the total nuclear charge minus the shielding term. The level of shielding performed by each electron depends on the orbital and shell it is in.

Accurately calculating the effective nuclear charge felt by a particular electron in a particular orbital of a particular element is very complicated. It requires computer models and is beyond the scope of this course. However, it forms the basis for our understanding of chemical reactivity since we have seen that the energy of an atomic orbital depends on <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle Z_{eff}">:

### Orbital Approximation

To be clear, we cannot solve the Schrodinger equation exactly for multi-electron systems but instead use a modified potential which is spherically symmetric and centered on the nucleus. This modified potential is then used to calculate the forms of the atomic orbitals - this is the orbital approximation. This is shown schematically below:

The energy of an orbital determines the how compact or diffuse (spread out) it will be and consequently how well it will overlap with other atomic orbitals to form bonds. Good overlap leads to strong bonds and vice versa. This will be discussed further in the Molecular Orbital course.
