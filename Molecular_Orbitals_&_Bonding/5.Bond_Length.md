# Bond Lengths

A justifiable question at this stage is: “if the in phase overlap of orbitals produces bonding MOs which, when filled with electrons, reduce the energy of the system and the overlap is best when orbitals are close, what stops the nuclei simply coming together?”  
We know in practice that the nuclei of atoms which are chemically bonded do not simply merge together; rather, using clever spectroscopic techniques, we can measure bond lengths and find there are on the order of 10−1010−10m. The nuclei will repel each other if they get close due as they are both positively charged. Therefore, there is a balance between good orbital overlap and avoiding large repulsion between nuclei. 
This leads to the potential energy plot below with an energy minimum corresponding to the equilibrium separation.

A common equation used to model situations like this is the Lennard Jones 12-6 equation where the potential energy UU is expressed as a function of separation r:

Where ϵ and σ are situation-specific constants.
