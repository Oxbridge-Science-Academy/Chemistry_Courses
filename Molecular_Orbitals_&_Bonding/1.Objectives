# Objectives

1. To understand how atomic orbitals can interact to form molecular orbitals which form the basis for covalent bonds.
 
2. To understand the different types and geometries of orbital interaction and the different bonds which result.
 
3. To understand what MO diagrams show us and how they aid our understanding of MO shape and distribution.
