# AO contributions to MOs

When degenerate atomic orbitals form molecular orbitals, the starting AOs are both the same distance in energy from the bonding  MO. Therefore both AOs contribute equally to both the bonding MO. This case is shown below. 

However, the orbitals forming MOs are often not degenerate. In this case, the lower energy orbital (AO2) is closer in energy to the bonding MO and the higher energy orbital (AO1) is closer in energy to the anti-bonding MO. This means AO2 contributes to the bonding MO more than AO1 does and vice versa. This is shown below. 



### Visualising unequal contributions 
The bonding MO will be unevenly distributed, weighted towards the AO2 side. In practice, this means that the isosurface of the bonding MO will appear bigger near the nucleus of atom 2 than for atom 1. As expected then, the anti-bonding MO will be weighted towards the AO1 side.

Visualising unequal contributions
Below is shown the σσ (bonding) MO formed by the overlap of 2px2px orbitals from carbon and fluorine. The overall shape of MO is similar to that formed by two degenerate AOs (see the bonding MO shown in Section 5) but it is clear that it is weighted more towards fluorine.  


By contrast, the σ∗σ∗(anti-bonding) MO is weighted more towards the carbon (shown below). The general features of a σ∗σ∗ MO formed from two p orbitals are still present. 

It should be noted that in reality ionic bonding is more complicated than this but the idea that there is a sliding scale between purely covalent bonding (degenerate AOs overlapping) to (almost) purely ionic bonding (overlapping AOs of very different energy) is a useful framework.
