### Q1
Draw the following orbitals on the following atoms showing how bonding and anti-bonding  MOs are formed (where atoms 1 and 2 are adjacent). 

(a) a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> on atom 1 and an s orbital on atom 2

(b) a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> on atom 1 and a p orbitals on atom 2. 

### Q2
Using an MO diagram, suggest whether the following molecules exist based on energetic concerns:

(a) diatomic Helium <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_2">

(b) <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_{2}^{+}">

### Q3
Which of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle F_2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle F_{2}^{-}"> is likely to be more energetically favourable?

### Q4
Derive an expression in term of ùúñ and/or ùúé for the equilibrium separation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle r_{eq}"> and the minimum energy <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle U_{min}">.

### Q5
How does <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle U_{min}"> relate to the energy required to break the bond?

### Q6
Draw the anti-bonding œÄ‚àó MO formed by the out-of-phase overlap of two 2pz orbitals. Mark on any nodal planes and suggest why their presence would raise the energy of the MO.
 
### Q7
œÄ bonds can occur via the side-on overlap of other atomic orbitals. Draw the side-on overlap (in phase and out of phase on separate plots) between the following orbitals (where atoms 1 and 2 are adjacent), including the phase of the orbital lobes. You do not need to draw the the resulting MOs. 

(a) a dxy orbital on atom 1 and a 2py orbital on atom 2 

(b) a dxy orbital on atom 1 and a dxy  orbital on atom 2 

### Q8
Show, via sketches, that there would be no net overlap between teh following orbitals (where atoms 1 and 2 are adjacent):

(a) a dxy on atom 1 and a 2pz orbital on atom 2

(b) a 2pz on atom 1 and a 2px orbital on atom 2

(c) a dxy on atom 1 and an s orbital on atom 2

[Hint" draw out the AOs and then consider which plane or planes (xy, xz, yz) the overlap is best shown in.]
