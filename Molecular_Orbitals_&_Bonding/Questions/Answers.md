### Q2
Using an MO diagram, suggest whether the following molecules exist based on energetic concerns:

(a) diatomic Helium <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_2">

(b) <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_{2}^{+}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_2"> - Both the bonding and anti-bonding MOs are filled. It turns out that the antibonding MO is raised (slightly) more in energy than the bonding MO is lowered relative to the atomic orbitals (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Delta E_ab > \Delta E_b">) so in fact <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_2"> is unstable as its energy is greater than that of two separate He atoms. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_{2}^{+}"> - there is one fewer electron in this case and so the bonding MO is full but the antibonding MO is only partially filled. Therefore, the 2 electrons in the bonding MO lower the energy of the molecule more than the one electron in the antibonding MO raises it and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_{2}^{+}"> is stable.

### Q3
Which of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle F_2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle F_{2}^{-}"> is likely to be more energetically favourable?

For <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle F_2"> we only need consider the overlap of the single half filled p orbital on each F atom. As there are only 2 electrons involved in bonding, the bonding MO will be full and the anti-bonding MO empty. 

In <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle F_{2}^{-}"> there is an extra electron which has to go into the anti-bonding MO< resulting in a MO diagram simialr to the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle He_{2}^{+}">. The extra in the anti-bonding MO will raise the energy of the system and make it less energetically favourable. 

### Q4
Derive an expression in term of ùúñ and/or ùúé for the equilibrium separation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle r_{eq}"> and the minimum energy <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle U_{min}">. What units could be used for ùúé?

### Q5
How does <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle U_{min}"> relate to the energy required to break the bond?

The value of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle U_{min}"> is (almost) equivalent to the energy required to break the bond.

### Q6
Draw the anti-bonding œÄ‚àó MO formed by the out-of-phase overlap of two 2pz orbitals. Mark on any nodal planes and suggest why their presence would raise the energy of the MO.

Two views of the œÄ‚àó MO are shown below.

The extra node perpendicular to the internueclear axis restricts the space the electrons can occupy and this increases the energy of electrons in the anti-bonding MO.

### Q7
œÄ bonds can occur via the side-on overlap of other atomic orbitals. Draw the side-on overlap (in phase and out of phase on separate plots) between the following orbitals (where atoms 1 and 2 are adjacent), including the phase of the orbital lobes. You do not need to draw the the resulting MOs. 

(a) a dxy orbital on atom 1 and a 2py orbital on atom 2 - two views for the bonding and anti-bonding MOs are shown
