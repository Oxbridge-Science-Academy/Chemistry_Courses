# Sigma Bonding

The interaction between atomic orbitals depends on the relative orientation of the respective atomic orbitals. Sigma (œÉ) bonding is a type of bonding which occurs when atomic orbitals overlap ‚Äúhead-on‚Äù. s, p and d orbitals can all participate in œÉœÉ bonding. The electron density in œÉ bonds is primarily along the inter-nuclear axis which means they are typically stronger than pi (œÄ) bonds (discussed later). Bonding MOs formed by sigma interactions are denoted œÉ and anti-bonding MOs are denoted œÉ‚àó.

### Bonding MO

Consider the case of two 1s orbitals overlapping in phase as shown below.

Using the LCAO method, we can express the two MOs that will form (bonding and anti bonding) as linear combinations of the two hydrogen 1s orbital wavefunctions <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi_a"> 
and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi_b">. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi=\sum_i c_i \phi _i">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi= c_a \phi_a">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  c_b \phi_b">

Since the two AOs are identical and therefore have the same energy, we know that the coefficients caca and cbcb will be equal in magnitude. In other words, each AO contributes equally to the bonding MO, and will therefore contribute equally to the anti-bonding MO. 


For the bonding MO, the coefficients will be entirely equivalent (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  c_a=c_b">) and therefore the MO wavefunction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi"> is proportional to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \phi_a">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi_b">; this is overlap in phase. Below is shown the œÉ bonding MO which results.

### Anti-bonding MO

For the anti-bonding MO, the coefficient of the atomic orbitals have opposite sign (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  c_a=-c_b">). The MO wavefunction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \psi">  is proportional to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \phi_a-\phi_b">; this is overlap out of phase. The MO in this case resembles the two opposite phase H1s orbitals shown below

It is important to remember that when the atomic orbitals interact, both bonding and anti-bonding molecular orbitals are formed - we do not observe just one or the other. 
 
### Energy Considerations
The overlap forms a sigma bonding MO containing 2 electrons where the majority of the electron density is found between the two nuclei. Each electron‚Äôs energy is lowered by ŒîE so the net energy benefit is ‚àí2ŒîE. Note that the anti-bonding MO makes no contribution to energy change of the system because it contains no electrons.

Each AO contributes equally to the MO so the MO is not weighted more to one side than the other. This is shown in the energy level diagram by the fact that the AOs are equidistant in energy from the bonding and anti-bonding MOs.
The anti-bonding MO is higher in energy than the two AOs - there are two reasons for this.  

1. Compared to the bonding MO, the anti-bonding MO has much greater electron density outside the internuclear region. This electron density pulls the nuclei apart and increases the energy of the system.

2. The presence of a node (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle |\psi|^2=0">) in the molecular orbital between the two nuclei confines the electrons to a smaller region of space than in the bonding MO where there is no node. This is because as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle |\psi|^2=0">, electrons cannot be found at the node. The confinement raises the kinetic energy of any electrons in the anti-bonding MO. 

Let's consider how sigma MOs can formed by the overlap of other AOs. 

### Considering wavefunctions 

#### Bonding 
The wavefunction of an s orbital has the form <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi \propto e^{-r}">. Along the ùë• axis this becomes <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi \propto e^{-x}">. Rather than just drawing the ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù between orbitals to form MOs, let‚Äôs consider it quantitatively.  Shown below are the profiles of two wavefunctions and their sum (the MO) along along the internuclear axis. 

![alt text](https://github.com/Oxbridge-Science-Academy/Chemistry_Courses/blob/master/Molecular_Orbitals_%26_Bonding/Figures/s_wavefunction_in_phase.png)

The important feature to note is that in between the nuclei, the MO wavefunction is greater than the AO wavefunction. Since the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle |\psi|^2 \propto"> probability of finding an electron at a particular point, there is a greater chance of finding an electron in the internuclear region than if we just had two hydrogen atoms adjacent to each other 
‚üπ a chemical bond.

#### Anti-bonding 
Now consider the anti-bonding case (shown below). The fact that the anti-bonding MO wavefunction has a node (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi=0">) directly between the nuclei. As <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle |\psi|^2 \propto"> probability of finding an electron at a particular point, there is a zero probability of finding an electron there.

## p orbitals

### Bonding MOs
Consider the case of two 2px orbitals overlapping in phase head on as shown below.

![alt text](https://github.com/Oxbridge-Science-Academy/Chemistry_Courses/blob/master/Molecular_Orbitals_%26_Bonding/Figures/Two%202px%20head%20on%20in%20phase%201.png)


This in phase overlap will produce a bonding MO:

![alt text](https://github.com/Oxbridge-Science-Academy/Chemistry_Courses/blob/master/Molecular_Orbitals_%26_Bonding/Figures/Two%202px%20head%20on%20in%20phase%20MO.png)

Note how this looks quite different to the bonding MO formed by the overlap of two 1s orbitals. In the case above, the MO contains both positive and negative phase which makes sense as both constituent 2px orbitals contain postive and negative phase. 

### Anti-bonding MOs

Out of phase overlap, as shown below, must also be considered.

![alt text](https://github.com/Oxbridge-Science-Academy/Chemistry_Courses/blob/master/Molecular_Orbitals_%26_Bonding/Figures/Two%202px%20head%20on%20out%20of%20%20phase%201.png)


The resulting MO will resemble the two separate 2px orbitals. 


## s + p orbitals

### Bonding MOs
Sigma bonding between s and p orbitals is found in the hydrogen halide species (HF, HCl etc). Below is shown the in phase overlap of an H 1s and F 2pz (top) and the resulting bonding MO (bottom). 

![alt text](https://github.com/Oxbridge-Science-Academy/Chemistry_Courses/blob/master/Molecular_Orbitals_%26_Bonding/Figures/H1s%20%2B%202pz.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/Oxbridge-Science-Academy/Chemistry_Courses/blob/master/Molecular_Orbitals_%26_Bonding/Figures/H1s%20%2B%202pz%20MO.png)

The bonding MO looks similar to the 2pz atomic orbital but note that the positive red lobe is distorted from the shape it had in the 2pz due to the 1s orbital with which is has overlapped. 

### Anti-bonding MOs
By constrast, the out of phase overlp produces a quite different molecular orbital with two nodes.

## Other Combinations
Sigma bonding can occur between d orbitals and between d and s/p orbitals. Below are two examples showing the required orientation for sigma bonding to occur between a a dz2 and an s orbital (top) and a p orbital (bottom).
