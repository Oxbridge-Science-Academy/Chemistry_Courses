# Sigma Bonding

The interaction between atomic orbitals depends on the relative orientation of the respective atomic orbitals. Sigma (σ) bonding is a type of bonding which occurs when atomic orbitals overlap “head-on”. s, p and d orbitals can all participate in σσ bonding. The electron density in σσ bonds is primarily along the inter-nuclear axis which means they are typically stronger than pi (ππ) bonds (discussed later). Bonding MOs formed by sigma interactions are denoted σσ and anti-bonding MOs are denoted σ∗.

### Bonding MO

Consider the case of two 1s orbitals overlapping in phase as shown below.

Using the LCAO method, we can express the two MOs that will form (bonding and anti bonding) as linear combinations of the two hydrogen 1s orbital wavefunctions <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi_a"> 
and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi_b">. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi=\sum_i c_i \phi _i">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi= c_a \phi_a">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  c_b \phi_b">

Since the two AOs are identical and therefore have the same energy, we know that the coefficients caca and cbcb will be equal in magnitude. In other words, each AO contributes equally to the bonding MO, and will therefore contribute equally to the anti-bonding MO. 


For the bonding MO, the coefficients will be entirely equivalent (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  c_a=c_b">) and therefore the MO wavefunction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi"> is proportional to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \phi_a">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi_b">; this is overlap in phase. Below is shown the σ bonding MO which results.

### Anti-bonding MO

For the anti-bonding MO, the coefficient of the atomic orbitals have opposite sign (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  c_a=-c_b">). The MO wavefunction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \psi">  is proportional to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle  \phi_a-\phi_b">; this is overlap out of phase. The MO in this case resembles the two opposite phase H1s orbitals shown below

It is important to remember that when the atomic orbitals interact, both bonding and anti-bonding molecular orbitals are formed - we do not observe just one or the other. 
 
### Energy Considerations
The overlap forms a sigma bonding MO containing 2 electrons where the majority of the electron density is found between the two nuclei. Each electron’s energy is lowered by ΔEΔE so the net energy benefit is −2ΔE−2ΔE. Note that the anti-bonding MO makes no contribution to energy change of the system because it contains no electrons. 

Each AO contributes equally to the MO so the MO is not weighted more to one side than the other. This is shown in the energy level diagram by the fact that the AOs are equidistant in energy from the bonding and anti-bonding MOs.
The anti-bonding MO is higher in energy than the two AOs - there are two reasons for this.  

1. Compared to the bonding MO, the anti-bonding MO has much greater electron density outside the internuclear region. This electron density pulls the nuclei apart and increases the energy of the system.

2. The presence of a node (|ψ|2=0|ψ|2=0) in the molecular orbital between the two nuclei confines the electrons to a smaller region of space than in the bonding MO where there is no node. This is because as |ψ|2=0|ψ|2=0, electrons cannot be found at the node. The confinement raises the kinetic energy of any electrons in the anti-bonding MO.
