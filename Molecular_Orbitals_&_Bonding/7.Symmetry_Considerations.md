# Symmetry Considerations

The importance of symmetry in orbital interactions has already been hinted at. The symmetry of orbitals and how it affects their interactions is a mathematically rigourous and complex field and well beyond the scope of this course. However, we can still consider symmetry in a qualitative way.

For two atomic orbitals to interact they must have the “correct symmetry”. What does “correct symmetry mean? For now we will take it to mean that when two AOs overlap, the interaction is clearly bonding or antibonding. 
We will explore this with two examples.
 
### Example 1

Below is shown two views of the same side on interaction between a 1s orbital and a 2px orbital. Note how the s orbital is equidistant from a same phase lobe (bonding) and opposite phase lobe (anti-bonding) so there is no net interaction.

### Example 2

Here we have a 2pz and 2py orbtals which are orthogonal to each other and so there is no net overlap.

When viewed in the xy pane, the lack of net overlap is more apparent.
