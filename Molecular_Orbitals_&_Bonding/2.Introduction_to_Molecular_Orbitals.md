# Introduction to Molecular Orbitals

### Atomic Orbital Recap 

Atomic orbitals are 3-dimensional wavefunctions which satisfy the atomic Schrödinger equation and have 3 unique quantum numbers <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle n, l, m_l ">. 

The 3 types of orbital you will encounter most frequently in chemistry at the s, p and d orbitals. s orbitals are singly-degenerate and spherically symmetric. p orbitals are triply degenerate and lie along the xx, yy or zz axes. d orbitals are 5-fold degenerate and have more complex shapes. Orbitals can have positive and negative phases, indicated by the sign of the wavefunction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi"> .

Information about a system/orbital (e.g. radial distance at which electron is most likely to be found) can be obtained by performing mathematical operations on the wavefunctions.

We use an approximation that electrons feel a modified nuclear charge due to the screening effects of other electrons. The level of screening depends on the type of orbital. The effective nuclear charge, ZeffZeff, affects orbital energy and size and therefore affects the ability of a particular orbital to form a bond.

### Molecular Orbitals

When atomic orbitals (AO) from different atoms get close in space, they interact. In chemistry this interaction is termed overlap and it can lead to the formation of molecular orbitals (MO). A molecular orbital is also a wavefunction and a solution to a Schrödinger equation but now this equation describes the whole molecule rather than a single atom as was the case for atomic orbitals. 

When atomic orbitals overlap, the number of orbitals is always conserved so if two AOs overlap, two MOs will be formed. 
When considering the overlap between atomic orbitals we need to think about 2 things:
1. do the orbitals have the correct symmetry to overlap?
2. if they do have the correct symmetry, are they close in energy and of the right size to overlap 


The symmetry consideration is binary - orbitals with the correct symmetry will overlap (although the strength of the overlap may be very weak) and orbitals without the correct symmetry will not overlap at all, regardless of energy and size match. The symmetry of atoms, molecules and orbitals is a complex topic beyond the scope of this course but we will demonstrate the importance of symmetry with some examples in due course. 
 
Once we have established that overlap is possible, we can consider its strength. The overlap of two contracted AOs close together will produce a stronger bond than between diffuse AOs. Orbitals with very different energies will overlap poorly and produce weak bonds. You will hopefully now start to see the importance of the energy of AOs that was discussed in the Atomic Orbitals course. 

### Visualising Molecular Orbitals 

Like atomic orbitals, molecular orbitals are 3-dimensional functions so need 4 dimensions to be properly viewed which is not possible. However, as discussed in the AO course, we can plot isosurfaces of MOs and this is the common practice here. Therefore, when a "3-dimensional" orbital is shown, it is important to remember that this image shows the surface containing all the points where the orbital's wavefunction has the same value (strictly, as we show both positive and negative phases in the same plot, were are showing the surfaces where the magnitude of the wavefunction |ψ||ψ| is the same). 
Just as the wavefunction of an atomic orbital can be positive or negative, the wavefunction of a molecular orbital can be positive or negative - again we use the terminology of phases with positive phases denoted by red lobes and negative phases with blue. 

In some instances, the isosurfaces are shown in a particular plane (e.g. xyxy plane) to highlight a particular detail of the shape and orientation of a molecular orbital.  

### Constructing Molecular Orbitals

So far we have described molecular orbitals as arising from the interaction of atomic orbitals. This is still quite vague - how can we express this mathematically? We use a method called linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). In brief, this involves considering all the possible atomic orbitals which could overlap (some can be discarded based on symmetry) and expressing a molecular orbital wavefunction, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi">, as the sum of the AO wavefunctions <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \phi _i">, each multiplied by a coefficient <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle c_i">:
 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \psi=\sum_i c_i \phi _i = c_1 \phi _1"> +

Where the sum is over all i atoms present.

In due course, the link between a particular orbital's phase and the sign of its coefficient <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle c_i ">  will be made evident. 
This course will focus primarily on molecular orbitals made up of just 2 atomic orbitals but it should be understood that the LCAO method allows for the construction of MOs from more than 2 AOs, for example benzene or the carboxylate anion.
