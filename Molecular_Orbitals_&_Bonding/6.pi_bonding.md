# pi bonding

p and d orbitals can overlap side on to form pi (π) bonds. Due to their spherical symmetry, s orbitals can’t form π bonds. 

The electron density in π bonds is primarily above and below the inter-nuclear axis as opposed to along the inter-nuclear axis in σσ bonding. This means that π bonds are normally weaker than σ bonds and as a result the bonding π MOs are lowered less in energy relative to the constituent AOs compared to σσ MOs and the anti-bonding MOs are raised less in energy. 

Bonding MOs formed by π interactions are denoted π and anti-bonding MOs π∗.

The most common π interaction you will encounter is between two p orbitals. Consider two 2pz from two carbon atoms in ethene (C2H4) overlapping side on in phase as shown below in 3 dimensions (top) and in the xz plane (bottom).

It should be clear that the resulting molecular orbital (shown below) will be bonding (as overlap is in phase) and and will have a node along the internuclear axis (just as the two 2pz orbitals do) since the phases of the lobes above and below are the same.

### MO diagrams 
MO diagrams for pi bonds are very similar to those for sigma. The major difference is the notation for bonding (π) and anti-bonding (π∗) molecular orbitals.

As mentioned previously, since π bonds involve side on overlap which is less effective than head on overlap, they are typically weaker and the energy difference between the MOs and constituent AOs, ΔE′, is less than for  σ bonds.
