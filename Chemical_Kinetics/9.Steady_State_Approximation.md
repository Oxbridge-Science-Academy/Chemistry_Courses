# Steady State Approximation

We can extend the idea of sequential reactions and the analysis discussed in the previous section to a very common example - the steady state approximation.

Consider a reaction consisting of two steps:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C ">

Where the first step has rate constant <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle k_1"> and the second step rate constant <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle k_2">. 

While this may appear strange, such a situation is common in chemistry. A could represent an unstable species which undergoes a unimolecular reaction to form an intermediate B which then decays into stable product C.
We can write differential equations for the three species:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_1[A] ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_1[A] - k_2[B] ">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{d[B]}{dt} =  k_2[B] ">

You should ensure you understand how these differential equation have been reached - see Sequential Reactions if you are not sure. 


Solving this system is not impossible but if we included further reactions such as reverse reactions (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle B \rightarrow A"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle C \rightarrow B">), matters swiftly become very complicated. 

However, some simplifications can be made in a particular circumstance, specifically when: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle k_2 \gg k_1"> 
 
In this case, species B is produced much more slowly than it is destroyed. In other words, as soon as it is produced it reacts further and so its concentration will never build up. Furthermore, the rate of change of B is also negligible as it never exceeds miniscule concentrations. This means we can write:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{d[B]}{dt} = 0"> 

Equating this to the expression we derived earlier:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \frac{d[B]}{dt} = 0 = k_1[A] - k_2[B]"> 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Rightarrow k_1[A] = k_2[B]"> 


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \Rightarrow [B] = \frac{k_1[A]}{k_2}"> 


−k1[A]+k2[B]=0−k1[A]+k2[B]=0
[B]=k1k2[A][B]=k1k2[A]
Deriving explicit expressions for [A], [B] & [C][A], [B] & [C] is left for the student. 
The production the final product CC can also be expressed as:
d[C]dt=k2[B]=k1[A]d[C]dt=k2[B]=k1[A]
and we see that it mirrors the loss of initial reactant AA.
This is known as the Steady State Approximation and is used to simplify the kinetics of complex schemes. It is only valid when the rate of loss of a species (in this case BB) is much faster than its production. The energy plot below shows a situation where steady state is applicable. AA corresponds to "reactants", BB the "intermediate" and CC the "products". This plot is also more rigorous and includes the reverse reaction B→AB→A with rate coefficient k−1k−1. For BB to be in steady state, the reverse reaction B→AB→A must also be much slower than B→CB→C.
