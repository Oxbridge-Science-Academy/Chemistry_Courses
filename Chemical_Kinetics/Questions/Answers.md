### Q4
When 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t=t_{\frac{1}{2}}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[X]=\frac{[X]_0}{2}">. 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[X] =\frac{[X]_0}{2} = [X]_0e^{-kt_{\frac{1}{2}}}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1}{2} = e^{-kt_{\frac{1}{2}}}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\ln 2}{2k}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ln 2"> is just a constant and as the rate constant does not vary with time, the half life is fixed. 
 
 ### Q5

In practice, the easiest way to verify a relationship is to choose variables which, when plotted against each other, give a straight line because it is much more straightforward to determine whether a line is straight compared to trying to confirm if a part of curve is polynomial or logarithmic, for example. It is also easier to measure parameters of a straight line (gradient, intercepts) from which other parameters can be calculated. 

Given the expression:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[X]=[X]_0e^{-kt}">

plotting [X] against t will yield a curve if the reaction is first order but it will hard to be sure the curve is exponential and also very difficult to deduce the value of k.

However, taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ln[X]=\ln[X]_0 -kt">

Now plotting ln[X] against t will yield a straight line (if the relationship is 1storder) with gradient equal to âˆ’k and vertical axis intercept equal to ln[X]<sub>0</sub>.

### Q6

Using the equation rate=k[X], a plot of initial rate against [X] will yield a straight line passing through the origin with gradient k.

A plot of rate against time is a little more complicated. 
We can write:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle rate=-\frac{d[X]}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}[X]_0e^{-kt}">

Thus we arrive at:
 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=rate=k[X]_0e^{-kt}">

Thus we see that the rate decays exponentially with just as [X] does. This makes sense since when [X] is high, its rate of loss will be high.
