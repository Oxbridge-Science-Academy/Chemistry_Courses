# Rate Constants

You are likely to encountered rate constants (also referred to as rate coefficients) before. They allow the temperature dependence on rates of reaction to be expresed matheamtically. While not always the case, the majority of the reactions you will encounter in undergraduate chemistry speed up with temperature - they have a positive temperature dependence. 

The temperature dependence is represented in the rate constant, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle k">:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle k=Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}">

Where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle A"> is the pre-exponential factor (temperature independent to a first approximation), <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle E_a"> is the activation energy, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle R"> is the gas constant and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle T"> is the temperature in Kelvin. 
A plot of kk against TT (as shown below) produces a curve from which it is hard to extract information about the parameter of interest, Ea.Ea.
